-- | Defines a type-level parent route. Takes a path, which
-- | is prepended to all child routes, and a spec, which must
-- | be a type-level record. If the path contains named URL parameters,
-- | the types of those parameters must be given in the `params` field
-- | of the spec record. Can optionally contain a `guards` field with
-- | a list of guards to run before calling child routes. All other
-- | fields are treated as endpoint routes or sub-parent routes.
-- | 
-- | Example:
-- | ```purescript
-- | Routes "/users/<userId>" {
-- |   guards :: Guards ("apiKey" : Nil),
-- |   params :: { userId :: Int },
-- |   posts :: GET "/posts" {
-- |     response :: UserPosts
-- |   }
